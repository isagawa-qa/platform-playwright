# /qa-on-failure

Read and follow the on-failure checkpoint.

## Instructions

1. **Read the checkpoint skill file:**

   Read `.claude/skills/qa-management-layer/checkpoints/on-failure.md`

2. **Follow the HITL protocol** — Present the failure report to user

3. **WAIT for user response** before taking any action

This checkpoint ensures you do not attempt autonomous fixes. You must stop, report, and wait for user direction.

**Do not skip this checkpoint. HITL is mandatory.**
